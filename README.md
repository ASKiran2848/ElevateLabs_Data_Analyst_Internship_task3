# ElevateLabs_Data_Analyst_Internship_task3

The objective of this task was to analyze structured data using SQL. An e-commerce sample database was used to perform various SQL operations such as data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, and views.

SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses were used to retrieve and sort data. Aggregate functions like COUNT were applied with GROUP BY and HAVING to summarize customer information. Subqueries helped in filtering data based on aggregated conditions.

To demonstrate relational data handling, INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN were used between customers and orders tables. A view was created for reusable analysis, and indexing was applied to optimize query performance.

Overall, this task improved understanding of SQL-based data analysis and real-world database querying techniques.
